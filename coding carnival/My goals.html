                <b><br><span style="font-size: larger;">For a long time, I wanted to change up the way I am seen, and improve overall. <br>Here are my top 5 goals I am planning to achieve by the end of the year:<br><br></b></span></p>
                <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li><u>Get rid of social anxiety</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>This is my No.1 goal for a good reason. I have been afraid to,<br>
                    participate in any social event for as long as I was in school. Instead<br>
                    of staying backstage in a school of many opportunities, I want to step out<br>
                    of my safe zone and be seen as a brave student, not a shy one. I want to<br>
                    finally start joining in clubs and extracurricular activities once and for all.<br><br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><u>Get better at creativity, and get recognised</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>Perhaps many do not know this, but I am quite fond of dancing, singing,<br>
                    anime drawing, and anything that allows me to express creativity. My goal is<br>
                    to get regonised by my skills, and not get scared to do so. I would like to<br>
                    start animating while doing digital art as well.<br><br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><u>Have more self-respect and feel "beautiful"</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>After I started getting puberty, I started to feel imperior towards other<br>
                    students due to my acne, extremely messy hair, and lack of self-respect. From 2022,<br>
                    I really want to aim changing how I feel like right now, and look after myself<br>
                    more often. I also plan on doing more workouts to get the body shape I want. Maybe<br>
                    then, I would stop feeling somewhat 'miserable' with the way I look.<br><br>
                </p>                   
                <br>
                <li><u>Find out my true personality</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>When I started making many friends in year 5, I realised that I acted differetly<br>
                    towards all of them, and that I really didn't have anyone who linked with the way I<br>
                    act. This year, I want to find out what my personality is really like, and make friends<br>
                    with that personality accordingly. I do not want to feel confused and misguided by others<br>
                    anymore.<br><br>   
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><u>Socialise more with my family</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>In my years as a year 5-6 person, I barely communicated with my mum, dad, grandma and<br>
                    grandpa. Whenever i'm at home, I spend 85% of my time facing the screen. I really want to<br>
                    fix the way I act towards my family, because it really does affect the way I feel about<br>
                    myself.<br><br>
                </p>

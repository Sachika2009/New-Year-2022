                      <p class="normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>One time, while I was getting inside the bus, a boy kept on covering his nose. 
                      I realised that something<br> really did stink in the bus, so when I went upstairs, I saw vomit all over 
                      4 seats at the back. But that's not all! After<br> that smelly bus ride, the same boy who kept covering his nose raged
                      at another boy, starting a whole <br>wrestle with the boys cursing at eachother like a movie. Actual damage was made, bruises, wounds, you name it!<br> My friend and I felt 
                      threatened, so we calmly speed-walked away from this incident. Rumor had it, the boy who got attacked made a very mean joke
                      relating to the vomit on the bus, and that related to past-time incidents...<br><br><img src="What">
                      <br><br>
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="normal"><br>On the 11th of March, I sat down on one of the most major academic exams in Australia, the NSW Selective <br>High School Placement Test.
                        <br><br><img src="nsw.PNG">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="pshs.png"><br><br>The test was quite a hassle, I had to study 7-9 hours per day! The good news is, my hard work paid off.<br>
                           Now, I will attend Penrith Selective High School this year!<br><br></p>
                           <br>
                           <p class="normal"><br>For the first time in 6 years, I finally attended a PSSA sports team! PSSA is an NSW sports system where <br>schools can compete against other schools in different sports. I played for our School's Softball<br> team. However, my opportunity
                        was wasted. It was bad weather almost every week, and the buses never came on the <br>remaining days! Not to worry, I have selected myself into sports
                       teams for highschool, so I still have chances!<br><br><img src="pssa.PNG"><br><br></p>
                       <br>
                       <p class="normal"><br>For my <abbr title="12.6.09">Birthday</abbr>, I was gifted an aquarium! It was 5.6.21 that day, and it was <br>
                        really cold. This is why I caught a cold while I was settng up the aquarium (with very cold water). <br>My dad was planning to buy 4 small fish and 4 large fish,
                        and to our surprise, we were only <br>allowed to buy 2 large fish, or 8 small fish! We cheated, and bought 2 spotty goldfish with 4<br>
                        very tiny stripy fish. <br><br><img src="fish.jpg" class="imgtwo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="stripy.jpg" class="imgtwo"><br><br> I guess we learnt our lesson, because every fish has died except for <br>
                        one stripy fish, a very agressive one who still to this day is alive.<br><br></p><br>

                        <p class="normal"><br>Sadly, during <abbr title="a period of 9-11 weeks">Term 3</abbr>, it was full-on <abbr title="A type of learning where you do your education through devices">remote learning</abbr>. During this<br>
                            time, it was pretty hard to learn without full contact of the teacher and without going to tuition. <br>Luckily, since it was <i>remote</i> learning, no teacher could tell if you are calling/playing with<br>
                            your friends or not! As soon as I finish my work, I chatted and played roblox with <br>my friends. That period was so much fun, I would game almost 3 hours per day! However, face-to-face learning is<br>
                            much better, so when the lockdown was over in Term 4, i was <i>over</i>joyed!<br><br><img src="roblox.png">
                            <br><br></p><br>

                        <p class="normal"><br>Term 4 was an all-round fun term. As it was the <i>last</i> term of Primary School, the teachers<br> weren't so strict. In fact, it really was all fun and games!
                            We did quizzes,<br> competed in the Teacher's vs Students matches, had a graduation ceremony, and to put a cherry-on-top,<br> a farewell dinner! Many strange things happened too... <br>
                            there was an love letter mystery <i>and</i> even an actual couple in our school! <br><br><img src="love letter.jpg" class="imgtwo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="mystery.png" class="annoying"><br><br>On 16.12.21, it was very hard to say
                            goodbye to a place I went to for 6 years, <br>and even more heart-breaking to lose my long-lasted friends! It is fine though, i have<br> all of their Skype accounts, so we now
                            chat almost daily. <br><br><img src="skype.jpg"><br><br></p>

                <li><u>New Friends</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>Ever since grade 4 started for me, I realised that most of my<br> friends have somewhat changed. 
                    A new school is like a new environment,<br> and i am so excited to finally start fresh and pop my
                    bubbled-up personality. <br><br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><u>New Environment</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>In my public school, I was seen as the "shy" kid who didn't really<br>
                    participate in anything. Now, with a new environment, I can change up <br>
                    how I am seen as, and improve as a person altogether.<br><br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><u>More Opportunities</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>I had a passion of doing visual arts and anything creative in general<br>
                    for a long amount of time. tennis was also in my 'interest' category. With<br>
                    more opportunities, I can really develop and improve what I love to do, and<br>
                    try out many other passions i've had for a long time!<br><br>
                </p>                   
                <br>
                <li><u>My 13th Birthday</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>In my years of being an 9-12 year old, I always wondered how it is like<br>
                    being a <i>teenager</i>. I am really excited about this birthday in particular<br>
                    'cuz I will be hosting it at a massive resteraunt! My best friends will finally<br>
                    be invited, along with the regularly invited guests.<br><br>   
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><u>Watching my little brother grow</u></li><p class="normalp">
                    <br>This year, my brother, Sheehan, will be attending Kindergarten! Just like<br>
                    me, he will be put into a completly new place, and will have a completly different<br>
                    routine. I have a lot of hope for him to make new friends, do great in studies, and<br>
                    finally experience life with a thousand kids, like me!<br><br>
